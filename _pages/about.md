I am an assistant professor of supply chain analytics in the [Marriott School of Business](https://marriottschool.byu.edu) at Brigham Young University.

Prior to coming to BYU, I got my PhD in the [Operations Research Center](http://orc.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under Professor [David Simchi-Levi](http://slevi1.mit.edu/). For my undergrad, I studied Mathematics at Brigham Young University. I was fortunate to work with Professor Robin Roundy, who gave me my main introduction to Operations Research.

Research interests include:

* Algorithms for pricing and assortment optimization
* Hospital operations management
* Sustainable Energy
