I am a PhD candidate in the [Operations Research Center](http://orc.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I work with Professor [David Simchi-Levi](http://slevi1.mit.edu/).

Currently, I am exploring statistics and optimization problems at the interface of marketing and operations management.
