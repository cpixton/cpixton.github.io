I am a PhD candidate in the [Operations Research Center](http://orc.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I work with Professor [David Simchi-Levi](http://slevi1.mit.edu/).

Currently, I am exploring statistics and optimization problems at the interface of marketing and operations management.

I also work with PillPack, Inc., a Somerville-based pharmacy, on both production optimization and customer lifetime value analysis.

Before coming to MIT, I studied Mathematics at Brigham Young University. There I was fortunate to work with Professor Robin Roundy, who gave me my main introduction to Operations Research.

Here's a link to my [CV](/assets/pdfs/Pixton_cv.pdf).
