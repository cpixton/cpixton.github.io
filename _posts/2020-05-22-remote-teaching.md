On Tuesday, March 10th, I crashed a Spin scooter and ended up visiting the hospital with a minor concussion (I felt so dumb!). 
For the sake of personal recovery, I cancelled my operations analytics classes on Wednesday.
Little did I know, classes would be cancelled again the following Monday to give faculty time to switch over to remote instruction.
What an odd week!
